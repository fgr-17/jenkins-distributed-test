# Jenkins Distributed Layout

This repo contains the basic data to create a distributed Jenkins layout:

* Jenkins controller: contains the actual Jenkins control
* Jenkins agents: one or more runner that execute the actual work, for example, compiling.

## Installation

The first step needed, before deploying the docker compose containers, is to generate the ssh keys on the local computer (where the docker engine is running). For that, a bash script is provided:

```bash
cd scripts
./generate-keys.sh <your mail>
```

After that, you should be able to create the containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
>>>>>

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
