# Jenkins Distributed Layout

This repo contains the basic data to create a distributed Jenkins layout:

* Jenkins controller: contains the actual Jenkins control
* Jenkins agents: one or more runner that execute the actual work, for example, compiling.

## Installation

The first step needed, before deploying the docker compose containers, is to generate the ssh keys on the local computer (where the docker engine is running). For that, a bash script is provided:

```bash
cd scripts
./generate-keys.sh <your mail>
```

After that, you should be able to create the containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Once you have the containers running, follow the Jenkins guidelines to configure a new node using ssh connection. Use the keys generated previosly on keys/ dir when required.


## Usage

This repository provides the basic layout for the creation of a Distributed Jenkins Layout. You should create multiple agents according your needs. Following the [Jenkins best practices](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/best-practices/), each agent should be dedicated to a single task.
